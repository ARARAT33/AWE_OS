# AWE_OS CellKernel — Project Status

**Project track:** AWE development project #2  
**Status:** Active development / preserved for continued work  
**Date:** 2026-08-27  
**Primary branch:** `main`  
**Preserved snapshot:** `archive/pre-restructure-2026-08-27`

## Purpose

This repository is a long-term development workspace for AWE_OS and its CellKernel foundation. It is intentionally kept as a living project rather than presented as a finished operating system.

The repository should remain buildable, testable, and easy to resume after periods of inactivity. New work should extend the existing architecture instead of replacing the project with an unrelated prototype.

## Current direction

The immediate focus is **engineering the bootable and testable AWE_OS core**, with emphasis on:

1. x86_64 boot and deterministic kernel entry
2. memory, paging, interrupts and CPU execution
3. processes, scheduling, syscalls, IPC and capabilities
4. hardware/service boundaries and VirtIO/QEMU execution
5. storage and networking runtime integration
6. AWOSA native runtime and package trust
7. AYUI and first-party userspace
8. recovery, validation and release evidence

## Project-state rules

- `main` is the active development line.
- Historical or superseded documentation must not be treated as current implementation evidence.
- Planned features must be labeled as planned, experimental, or pending validation.
- A passing static build is not equivalent to a bootable or production-ready OS.
- Runtime evidence should be attached to the milestone it validates.
- Security boundaries and ABI contracts must remain explicit and versioned.

## Documentation source of truth

Use this file for the high-level project state. Use `PRODUCT_READINESS.md` for release-readiness gates and `docs/AWE_OS_100_PERCENT_MASTER_PLAN.md` for the long-range implementation plan.

Older progress/evidence documents are retained as engineering history. Their dates and scope must be respected; they do not automatically describe the current state of `main`.

## Preservation

Before the documentation/project-state restructuring on 2026-08-27, the `main` tree was preserved as:

`archive/pre-restructure-2026-08-27`

That branch is the recovery point for the previous repository state and should not be deleted while the new development direction is being established.

## Next development cycle

The next implementation cycle should prioritize real execution evidence over percentage claims:

- QEMU boot smoke test
- kernel entry and early initialization evidence
- memory/paging execution checks
- interrupt/timer execution checks
- VirtIO device exercise
- storage/network runtime exercises
- userspace service startup
- package admission and recovery-path tests

## Long-term objective

Build AWE_OS incrementally into a real, reproducible, security-oriented operating system while keeping CellKernel small, modular, auditable, and suitable for continued development over multiple project cycles.
